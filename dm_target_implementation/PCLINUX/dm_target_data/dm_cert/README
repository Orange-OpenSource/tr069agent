Support for SSL
First you need a valid certificate to authentify ACS.
you cant get a certificate by doing :
$openssl s_client -connect ACS_hostname:port | tee logfile
copy the text from --BEGIN CERTIFICATE -- to --END CERTIFICATE-- in a file 
acs.pem, copy "acs.pem" in the "src" folder.
The Common Name of the certificate must be the same as the hostname in the URL.
ex : Common Name = r-lnx-idope then the URL to contact the ACS must be https://r-lnx-idope:port/xxxx
this is a mechanism to authenticate the host.
