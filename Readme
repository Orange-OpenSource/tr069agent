This is a branch for integrating Eventing mechanism by including pupnp library.
This branch is on the base of branch upnpigd_integration.

A static pupnp library is included in dm_target_nat/inc. This pupnp library has not been minimized.

This library allows the upnpigd_thread to subscribe a certain service and receive notifications.
Function used is gena_subscribe() in dm_upnpigd.c. This is a function defined in pupnp library.

Todo:
 1. ExternalIPAddress change scenario: Analyses notification messages (GENA). Principally decode XML message (notification message expressed in xml)
    and create a mechanism to re-create port mapping if received a notification about ExternalIPAddress changes.

 2. Gateway reboot scenario: Analyses multicast event message (SSDP). when a gateway reboots, gateway sends multicast event messages SSDP:byebye.
    And when gateway re-joins network, gateway announces its presence by multicast event messages too, SSDP:alive. Create a mechanism to re-create
    port mapping if received multicast event messages SSDP:byebye.

 3. Minimize pupnp library: only include the source code of necessary, delete unneeded ones.
