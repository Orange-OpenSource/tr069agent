This is a branch for UPnP IGD integration using miniupnp library.

Done:
  1. Included miniupnp library in dm_target_nat/inc.

  2. Created a upnpigd thread.
     Function DM_IGD_buildConnectionRequestUrl is called to build ConnectionRequestURL every time an Inform message is constructed.
     This function checks the presence of gateway and creates a port mapping if possible.
     Function refreshLeaseDuration is used to refresh Lease Duration before port mapping expires.

ToDo:
  1. Integrate Eventing mechanism. miniupnp library is not working properly with Eventing. Pupnp library is to be tested in branch subscribe_dev.

  2. Implement mechanism to re-create port mapping in these conditions:
      Gateway reboots or ExternalIPAddress changes.
